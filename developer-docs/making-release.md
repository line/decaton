Making a new release
====================

## Preparation

This step is required only at the first time you release an artifact on Maven Central.

1. Create an account for OSS Sonatype following [guide](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html).
2. Generate PGP key following this [guide](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html#generating-a-key-pair).
3. Export the generated key for use from Gradle.
```sh
$ gpg --export-secret-keys KEY_ID > ~/.gradle/pgp-keyring.gpg 
```
4. Edit (or create) `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with following content:
```properties
signing.keyId=// The last 8 symbols of the key ID that you can see with `gpg -K`
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/path/to/HOME/.gradle/pgp-keyring.gpg
signing.password=// Your PGP keyring password
sonatypeUsername=// OSS Sonatype username that you created at step 1
sonatypePassword=// OSS Sonatype password that you created at step 1
```

## Releasing SNAPSHOT version

Run `./scripts/publish.sh`.

NOTE: It takes some moment (~1h) until the published version becomes visible to users.

## Releasing release version

1. Check `:base_version:` of every documents under `./docs` to see if there's any article referring SNAPSHOT version. If any, strip SNAPSHOT suffix with carefully checking if the document is up-to-date with the version you're going to release. Then make a single commit to bump the document version and push it directly to the master branch.
2. Run `./script/publish.sh --release`.
3. Upon successful exit, login to https://oss.sonatype.org and click "Staging Repositories" in the left panel. ![staging-repo](staging-repositories.png)
4. Confirm you see an entry for decaton in staging repositories list. Check the box and press the "Close" button. ![staging-list](staging-list.png)
5. It will take some time to complete. Keep polling the screen until the "Release" button becomes clickable. ![release-ready](./release-ready.png)
6. Press the "Release" button and you're done! Against it takes some moment until it becomes visible to users. You can check out [maven central search](https://search.maven.org/search?q=decaton) to see if the version you released is now visible or not.
7. Create a new release from the pushed tag from https://github.com/line/decaton/releases . You can copy the template from the past release notes. Unfortunately the construction of release note is manually done for now.


Migrating a PGP key from one machine to another
===============================================

1. Find a key ID to migrate: `gpg -K`
2. Export the key: `gpg --export-secret-keys KEY_ID > gpg-secret.key`
3. Move the key to another machine
4. Import the key: `gpg --import gpg-secret.key`
