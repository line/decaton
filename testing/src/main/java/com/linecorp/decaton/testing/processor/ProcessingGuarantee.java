         * All messages are processed in order as produced per key, while allowing reprocessing.
         *
         * Note that if reprocessing happens, earlier tasks can be re-processed again
         * after later records got processed.
         *
         * Reprocessing can happen if a task is processed once but assigned to another instance by rebalance
         * before commiting offset and gets processed by another instance again.
         * This is likely to happen especially in some circumstances e.g. if you set max.pending.records to large value since
         * Decaton doesn't wait all pending tasks till complete before rebalance (and it's a design choice)
         *
         * Hence, what Decaton guarantees for process ordering can be formulated as below:
         * - if a task (offset:N) gets (re)processed, offset:N+M (M â‰¥ 1) always gets processed
         *
         * In addition, it's also be checked that if a task is committed, the task and preceding tasks never be reprocessed.
         *
         * Example:
         * <pre>
         * {@code
         *   say produced offsets are: [1,2,3,4,5]
         *   valid process ordering:
         *     - [1,2,3,4,5]
         *     - [1,2,1,2,3,4,5]: when processor restarted right after processed 2 before committing offset 1
         *     - [1,2,3,4,5,5]: when processor restarted right after processed 5 and committed 4 before committing offset 5
         *   invalid process ordering:
         *     - [1,3,2,4,5] => gapping
         *     - [1,2,3,4,5,4,3] => regressing to 4 implies offset 3 is committed. 3 cannot appear after processing 4
         * }
         * </pre>
