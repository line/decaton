= Task Compaction
:base_version: 0.0.43
:modules: processor

== Introduction
Task Compaction is a feature to hold a couple of tasks and decide which to process.

Decaton provides a *key-based* way to compact multiple tasks which are arrived within a given time.
The *key-based* means that only the tasks have the same key are the targets of compaction.

== When to use
When you don't need to process all incoming task but pick some of them within a given time.

=== Example
A location-based service collects a user's geo data from her mobile device.

The device reports recent location many times within a short period but you only need the latest data because it is not necessary to record all of the user's location.
Suppose you are using the user's id as a message key then you can use this feature to compact multiple geo data into one.

== Usage
To use `Task Compaction`, you need to do two things:

1. Instantiate `CompactionProcessor`
2. Add `CompactionProcessor` to the head of your processor pipeline.

=== CompactionProcessor
`CompactionProcessor` can be seen as a selector that decides whether a task should be kept or compacted. `CompactionProcessor` constructor takes two 
arguments:

|===
|parameter |Description

|`lingerMillis`
|You can think of it as a time window. When `lingerMillis` passed, the task accepted by the processor will be pushed to the following processor.

|`compactor`
|A function that takes two tasks and decides which task survived.
|===

Before getting started with the example, let's create a `LocationEvent` domain object which can be used to simulate the scenario we described:

[source,java]
.LocationEvent.java
----
public class LocationEvent {
    private long timestamp; // <1>
    private double latitude;
    private double longitude;

    // Getter and Setter
}
----
<1> We will use `timestamp` to decide to keep which task.

Add `CompactionProcessor` to the head of your processor pipeline, as shown in the following example `CompactionProcessor`:

[source,java]
.TaskCompactionMain.java
----
public class TaskCompactionMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ...
        ProcessorSubscription subscription =
                SubscriptionBuilder.newBuilder("my-decaton-processor")
                                   .processorsBuilder(
                                           ProcessorsBuilder
                                                   .consuming("my-decaton-topic", extractor)
                                                   .thenProcess(TaskCompactionMain::createCompactionProcessor, // <1>
                                                                ProcessorScope.THREAD)
                                                   .thenProcess(LocationEventProcessor::new, // <2>
                                                                ProcessorScope.THREAD)
                                   )
    }

    private static CompactionProcessor<LocationEvent> createCompactionProcessor() {
        return new CompactionProcessor<>(1000L, (left, right) -> { // <3>
            if (left.task().getTimestamp() == right.task().getTimestamp()) { // <4>
                return CompactChoice.PICK_EITHER; 
            } else if (left.task().getTimestamp() > right.task().getTimestamp()) {
                return CompactChoice.PICK_LEFT; // <5>
            } else {
                return CompactChoice.PICK_RIGHT; // <6> 
            }
        });
    }
}
----
<1> Add `CompactionProcessor` before any other processors.
<2> Then your actual processing logic.
<3> We set `lingerMillis` to `1000L`. It means that if a task arrived and is not compacted after 1000 milliseconds then it will be processed by the following processor `LocationEventProcessor`.
    Remember that the compactor takes two task, we name them *left* and *right* to follow the value of `CompactChoice`. This may give you a clear picture when choosing the task.
<4> You need to invoke `#task` to get concrete task.
<5> Return `CompactChoice.PICK_LEFT` means that *left* task survives.
<6> Return `CompactChoice.PICK_RIGHT` will keep the task which is newer. (i.e. arrived late)

== Implementation
In this section, we will briefly explain how is Task Compaction implemented.
All of the magic happened in `CompactionProcessor` when a task comes to this processor the following things happen:

1. The task will be put into a in-memory window
2. When subsequent tasks arrive, if a task which has the same key as the one exists in the window, `CompactionProcessor` will choose which to preserve based on the `compactor`.
   The winner will be preserved in the window while loser will be marked as completed.
3. The winner task will be passed to the downstream processor if the time it exists in the window exceeds `lingerMillis`.
