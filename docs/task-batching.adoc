= Task Batching
:base_version: 8.0.0
:modules: processor

== Introduction
Task Batching is a feature to batch several tasks of type `T` to `List<T>` and process them at once.

Decaton provides a *time-based* way and *size-based* way to batch multiple tasks.
The *time-based* means that tasks in past linger time are processed on every linger time.
The *size-based* means that tasks in past before reaching capacity are processed every time tasks’size reaches capacity.

== When to use (Example)
When downstream-DB supports batching I/O (which often very efficient)

== Usage
To use `Task Batching`, you need to create a class that inherits `BatchingProcessor`.

=== BatchingProcessor
`BatchingProcessor` is an abstract `DecatonProcessor` to batch several tasks of type `T` to `List<T>`. To implement this class, pass two arguments to the constructor and implement one abstract method:

|===
|parameter |Description

|`lingerMillis`
|Time limit for this processor. On every lingerMillis milliseconds, tasks in past lingerMillis milliseconds are pushed to `BatchingProcessor#processBatchingTasks(List)`.

|`capacity`
|Capacity size limit for this processor. Every time tasks’size reaches capacity, tasks in past before reaching capacity are pushed to `BatchingProcessor#processBatchingTasks(List)`.
|===

|===
|abstract method |Description

|`void processBatchingTasks(List<BatchingTask<T>> batchingTasks)`
|When the size or time reach each limit, this method is called with stored `batchingTasks`. +
After complete processing batch of tasks, *MUST* call `BatchingTask#completion` 's `DeferredCompletion#complete()` or `BatchingTask#context` 's `ProcessingContext#retry()` method for each `BatchingTask`. +
The above methods is not called automatically even when an error occurs in this method, so design it so that they are called finally by yourself. Otherwise, consumption will stick. +
`BatchingProcessor` realizes its function by using `ProcessingContext#deferCompletion()`. Reading `ProcessingContext#deferCompletion()` 's description will help you. +
This method runs in different thread from the `process(ProcessingContext<T>, T)` thread.
|===

[CAUTION]
====
* Batch-flush is done in `BatchingProcessor` 's scheduled executor thread.
* This means the parallelism of flushing has to be controlled by `ProcessorScope`, not only by `decaton.partition.concurrency` config. i.e.:

** Parallelize flushing per partition: `ProcessorScope.PARTITION`
** Parallelize flushing per processor thread: `ProcessorScope.THREAD`
====

Before getting started with the example, let's create a `HelloTask` domain object which can be used to simulate the scenario we described:

[source,java]
.HelloTask.java
----
public class HelloTask {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String text;

    // ... (Getter and Setter)
}
----
Create a class that inherits `BatchingProcessor`, as shown in the following example `InsertHelloTaskBatchingProcessor`:

[source,java]
.InsertHelloTaskBatchingProcessor.java
----
public class InsertHelloTaskBatchingProcessor extends BatchingProcessor<HelloTask> {
    public InsertHelloTaskBatchingProcessor(long lingerMillis, int capacity) {
        super(lingerMillis, capacity); // <1>
    }

    @Override
    protected void processBatchingTasks(List<BatchingTask<HelloTask>> batchingTasks) { // <2>
        List<HelloTask> helloTasks =
                batchingTasks.stream().map(BatchingTask::task).collect(Collectors.toList());
        helloTasks.forEach(
                task -> System.out.println("Processing task: " + task) // <3> (If it's real, insert tasks.)
        );
        batchingTasks.forEach(batchingTask -> batchingTask.completion().complete());
    }
}
----
Then, use this `InsertHelloTaskBatchingProcessor` class in your `ProcessorSubscription` setup:

[source,java]
.TaskBatchingMain.java
----
public class TaskBatchingMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... (Set up other options like default DecatonProcessor)
        long lingerMillis = 1000;
        int capacity = 100;
        ProcessorSubscription subscription =
                SubscriptionBuilder.newBuilder("my-decaton-processor")
                                   .processorsBuilder(
                                           ProcessorsBuilder
                                                   .consuming("my-decaton-topic", extractor)
                                                   .thenProcess(() -> createBatchingProcessor(lingerMillis,
                                                                                              capacity),
                                                                ProcessorScope.THREAD)
                                   )
                                    // ... (Set up other options and build)
    }

    private static BatchingProcessor<HelloTask> createBatchingProcessor(long lingerMillis, int capacity) {
        return new InsertHelloTaskBatchingProcessor(lingerMillis, capacity); // <1>
    }
}
----
<1> Pass `lingerMillis` and `capacity` to the constructor.
<2> Implement `processBatchingTasks(List)`.
<3> Call `BatchingTask#completion` 's `DeferredCompletion#complete()`.
