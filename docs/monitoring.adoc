Monitoring Decaton
==================
:base_version: 0.0.43
:modules: processor

This document guides you how to monitor your Decaton processor applications.
Decaton processor collects and provides its metrics through link:https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer].

You can choose any monitoring system Micrometer supports. (See link:https://micrometer.io/docs[Micrometer docs] for the details)

== Processor Metrics

=== Installation

To export Decaton metrics, all you have to do is to register your `MeterRegistry` to Decaton link:../processor/src/main/java/com/linecorp/decaton/processor/metrics/Metrics.java[Metrics] at application start-up.
If you use link:https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/prometheus[PrometheusMeterRegistry], registration can be done as follows.

[source,java]
----
PrometheusMeterRegistry registry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
Metrics.register(registry);
----

=== Metric Definitions

See link:../processor/src/main/java/com/linecorp/decaton/processor/metrics/Metrics.java[Metrics.java] for the full list of metric definitions.

In this section, we pick up some important metrics.
We recommend you to monitor at least these metrics in a production environment.

|===
|Name|Description

|decaton.tasks.processed
|The total number of tasks processed. This metric shows the throughput of your application.

|decaton.tasks.discarded
|The number of tasks discarded. This metric shows how many tasks are dropped during task extraction.
Droppings are often caused by invalid messages in a topic.

|decaton.tasks.error
|The number of tasks thrown exception by process.
Note that only synchronous failures during executing `DecatonProcessor#process()` are reported by this metric.

|decaton.tasks.process.duration
|The quantile summary of the time of a task taken to be processed.
This metric denotes the process latency summary.
High latency divergence between 50th and 99th implies that few heavy tasks can block other tasks.
In such situation, extending partition concurrency might help to improve the throughput.

|decaton.tasks.complete.duration
|The quantile summary of the time of a task taken to be completed.
This metric is basically same as `tasks.process.duration` unless you use asynchronous processing completion.

|decaton.partition.paused
|Indicate whether the partition (identified by `partition` label) is currently paused by back pressure or not by 1 or 0 value.
You can compute sum of all partitions on your monitoring system to tell how many partitions on an instance is currently paused.
If your consumer experiences many pauses, it might be indicating that your processor's throughput is not sufficient compared to tasks inflow.
|===

== Kafka Client Metrics

Since Decaton uses standard Kafka Java client (consumer/producer) internally, it's also a good idea to monitor Kafka client metrics.

Kafka clients provides a way to customize metric-reporting configuration via `metric.reporters` property.
If necessary, you can set `metric.reporters` property through `SubscriptionBuilder#consumerConfig` as usual Kafka consumer construction.
