Consuming Arbitrary Topic
=========================
:base_version: 0.0.43
:modules: common,protocol,processor

This document guides you how to consume and process topics containing records not consists of Decaton's protocol (not produced by DecatonClient) using Decaton processors.

By default, Decaton assumes messages are serialized as `DecatonTaskRequest` defined in link:../protocol/src/main/proto/Decaton.proto[Decaton.proto], and `DecatonProcessor` extracts the task from its `serialized_task` field.
But Decaton has the capability to consume arbitrary topics other than topics consisting records of Decaton protocol.

This means you can use Decaton as a drop-in replacement for a vanilla KafkaConsumer to leverage powerful features like deferred completion, delayed processing and so on.

Through this guide, we assume the topic is JSON-serialized and use link:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind[jackson-databind] for deserialization, but it's trivial to consume arbitrary formats other than JSON.

== TaskExtractor

First, you need to start by implementing your own link:../processor/src/main/java/com/linecorp/decaton/processor/TaskExtractor.java[TaskExtractor] to deserialize a task from raw message bytes.

[source,java]
.JSONUserEventExtractor.java
----
public class JSONUserEventExtractor implements TaskExtractor<UserEvent> {
    private static final ObjectMapper MAPPER = new ObjectMapper();

    @Override
    public DecatonTask<UserEvent> extract(byte[] bytes) {
        try {
            UserEvent event = MAPPER.readValue(bytes, UserEvent.class);
            TaskMetadata metadata = TaskMetadata.builder()
                                                // Filling timestampMillis is not mandatory, but it would be useful
                                                // when you monitor delivery latency between event production time and event processing time.
                                                .timestampMillis(event.getEventTimestampMillis())
                                                // This field is not mandatory too, but you can track which application produced the task by filling this.
                                                .sourceApplicationId("event-tracker")
                                                // You can set other TaskMetadata fields as you needed
                                                .build();

            return new DecatonTask<>(metadata, event, bytes);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
        }
    }
}
----

[CAUTION]
====
If `TaskExtractor#extract` throws an exception, an error will be logged and the task which was being processed will be discarded.
However the processor will continue to process subsequent tasks.
====

== DecatonProcessor

Second, let's implement a link:../processor/src/main/java/com/linecorp/decaton/processor/DecatonProcessor.java[DecatonProcessor] to process a UserEvent task.

[source,java]
.UserEventProcessor.java
----
public class UserEventProcessor implements DecatonProcessor<UserEvent> {
    @Override
    public void process(ProcessingContext<UserEvent> context, UserEvent task) throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.printf("Noticed %s is %d years old\n",
                          task.getName(),
                          task.getAge());
    }
}
----

As you can see, once you implement TaskExtractor, the implementation of the DecatonProcessor can be done as when you consume a regular Decaton topic.

Lastly, you need to instantiate link:../processor/src/main/java/com/linecorp/decaton/processor/runtime/ProcessorSubscription.java[ProcessorSubscription] as follows.

[source,java]
.UserEventProcessorMain.java
----
...

ProcessorsBuilder.consuming(
        "my-decaton-json-topic",
        // This line is the only difference from regular Decaton processor.
        new JSONUserEventExtractor())
                 .thenProcess(new UserEventProcessor())

...
----

You have to pass TaskExtractor which you implemented above instead of link:../common/src/main/java/com/linecorp/decaton/common/Deserializer.java[Deseiralizer].

== Run Example

Now we are ready to process a JSON topic.

Before trying out, let's download and extract the kafka binary from https://kafka.apache.org/downloads to use `kafka-console-producer.sh`.

After that, let's create `my-decaton-json-topic` then run the example processor and produce a JSON message.

[source,sh]
----
$ ./gradlew shadowJar

$ java -cp build/libs/example-*-all.jar -Dbootstrap.servers=$KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS example.UserEventProcessorMain &

$ /path/to/kafka_dir/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS --topic my-decaton-json-topic

> {"eventTimestampMillis":1571368115079,"name": "daisuke","age": 52}

Noticed daisuke is 52 years old
